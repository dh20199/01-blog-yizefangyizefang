              Dear Prof. Price,
                </div>

                <div class="text">
                       <p>
                           I was told to enrol in this class by someone, I don't know who. It seems like kind of a bad idea but I'm going to do it anyway because I don't have any ideas of my own and anyway I always do what I'm told. I have a couple of questions though, can you please answer them? 
</p> 
                       <h1>
                        Assignments
                       </h1>
                        <p>
                        Are the assignments actually required, or can I just say I did them?  In particular I am concerned about the following:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                        <li> - Assignment 1</li>
                        <li>- Assignment 2</li>
                        <li>- All the rest of the assignments</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h1>
                        Lectures
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                        Is there any point in coming to class? I looked you up on Rate My Little Pony (https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/840273242953005718/), and your ratings are pretty terrible.
                       </p> 
                       <h1>
                        Course Website
                        </h1>
                    <p>
                     I have taken a look at the course website. It sure seems pretty weird.  Do you mind if I just ignore this part?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I look forward to a fruitful semester. 
                    </p>
