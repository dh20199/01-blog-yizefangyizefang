Friedrich Nietzsche was a German philosopher whose works exerted great influence on many 20th-century thinkers. He was born in 1844 and was trained from a young age as a classicist, a scholar whose studies focus on ancient Greek and Roman literatures. He was appointed professor of Classical Philology at University of Basel at the age of 24, making him one of the youngest professors of his time. However, his success declined as his academic interest shifted from Classicism to Philosophy, and his first major publication, "The Birth of Tragedy", which provides a philosophical insight into the society of the ancient Greece based on his study of Greek tragedies, indicates this transition. This book was poorly received by the German academia of the time. Nietzsche's scholarship began to deviate more and more from that of his colleagues as his philosophical thoughts reached maturity. His final decision to break with one of his closest and most influential friend Richard Wagner marked the beginning of his most creative period, during which he published some of his most central works. His creativity ended abruptly along with his sanity. He died in 1900 of madness.

Nietzsche's philosophy was picked up by both the Left and the Right. The Left, inspired by his ruthless attack on universality, laid the foundation for post-modernist philosophy. However, some of his ideas like natural inequality and the will to power were used not long after his death by many alt-right thinkers to justify racial theories. As a result, after the Second World War, Nietzsche's name was mostly associated with Nazism in the English-speaking world. His reputation was not restored until the 1950s with Walter Kaulfmann's new translations and interpretations of his works.
