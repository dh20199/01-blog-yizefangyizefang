Re: enrollment in HIS393

Dear Prof. Price,

I was told to enrol in this class by someone, I don't know who. It seems like kind of a bad idea but I'm going to do it anyway because I don't have any ideas of my own and anyway I always do what I'm told. I have a couple of questions though, can you please answer them? 

Assignments

Are the assignments actually required, or can I just say I did them?  In particular I am concerned about the following:

- Assignment 1
- Assignment 2
- All the rest of the assignments

Lectures

Is there any point in coming to class? I looked you up on Rate My Little Pony (https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/840273242953005718/), and your ratings are pretty terrible.

Course Website

I have taken a look at the course website. It sure seems pretty weird.  Do you mind if I just ignore this part?

I look forward to a fruitful semester. 

Yours sincerely,
Your Name
